# train-project

In this homework assignment I have used firebase to store all the data for the trains information (name, destination, first time they set off, etc) which was taken from the inputs. I then used moment.js to calculate when the train will arrive as well as how many minutes away. 

I had some trouble completing the assignment. There are three extra appended rows with the time and NaN for minutes away which i could not get rid of.
